# RockPaperScissors

 ## overview
 A classic Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript. This project focuses on applying core Javascript concepts and logic structuring.


 ## What I Learned
 - Writing function and applying control flow with `if/else` and `switch`
 - Using loops to run multiple rounds of game
 - Generating random choices and comparing outcomes
 - Structuring a simple project from logic to execution
